        <p style="font-size:16pt;">C2S is a smart social networking platform where, using the data generated by users (messages, images, actions, connection to other platforms), it will learn and eventually deal with problems such as fake news, recommendation for topics such as education, gaming, movies, etc. as well as suggestions for new friends and groups with the closest content or common actions â€“ activities with other users. Also data such as how much a user is a more frequent buyer through advertising, the recognition of psychological state using emotional analysis of messages, etc. will be examined to lead to an even smarter social network.
            The above platform can be a model for more effective advertising for businesses, enhance the experience to a better user to user approach and implement a far more efficient use of all network services, since users will be able to socialise and transact with others who are closer to them in all their actions.
